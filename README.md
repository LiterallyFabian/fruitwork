# fruitwork

fruitwork is a simple game engine written in C++ and the SDL2 library. It was made for the CPROG course at Stockholm University, and isn't really intended for any other use.

## Course grading

### Grade D

- [ ] Frame limiter
- [ ] Different types of sprites in a hierarchy (for example, a moving sprite and a static sprite)

### Grade C

- [ ] A sprite sub class that can be animated
- [ ] The engine should be prepared for the application to install shortcuts (simple key presses). The application should be able to specify a key and a callback function that should be called when this key has been pressed

### Grade B

- [ ] The engine should be prepared for different stages / levels containing different objects.
- [ ] The keyboard shortcuts should be able to work on member functions
- [ ] There should be a text input field that can be used to enter text

### Grade A
- [ ] Collision detection between sprites should be on pixel level (not just bounding boxes)
- [ ] The engine should have support physics (gravity, friction, etc.)
